This repository contains all of the necessary files for my project on analyzing the prevalence of 
LGBTQIA+ characters in children cartoons that I completed in my INFO 201 course.

This repository includes:
- Three R Files to analyze the data and create the interactive graphs
- Cartoon dataset as an Excel file
- A link to the Shiny application that works the interactive graphs (https://noah-mcmahon.shinyapps.io/final-project-NoahMcMahon1414/)
- Five R Markdown Files for an introduction, conclusion, and explanations of each chart
