# Chart 1

For our first chart, we wanted to both breakdown the representation of LGBTQIA+ characters by the platform that they reside on as well as how often said characters were on the show (i.e. whether they were main, guest, recurring, or supporting characters). We found this secondary part of the breakdown especially interesting as some shows use LGBTQIA+ characters as a foil to the main character only, which does not allow the LGBTQIA+ character to truly shine. From our barplot, we can tell that Cartoon Network and Netflix are the top two platforms by a lot for LGBTQIA+ representation in their characters and shows. In addition, Cartoon Network has the highest number of guest, supporting, and recurring LGBTQIA+ characters, while Netflix has the highest number of main LGBTQIA+ characters.
