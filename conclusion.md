# Conclusion 

The analysis of our data indicates significant developments in societal acceptance and representation of the LGBTQIA+ community, particularly in recent years. Through comprehensive examination of trends and shifts in the portrayal and inclusion of LGBTQIA+ characters, as well as an exploration of production studios, we were able to derive several key insights.

Our initial findings, as presented in Table 1, reveal that among the two studios with the highest LGBTQIA+ representation, recurring characters, guest appearances, and main characters comprised the primary categories. This observation highlights the varying roles LGBTQIA+ characters assume within these productions.

Furthermore, the analysis of our second table demonstrates a general upward trajectory in the prevalence of LGBTQIA+ representation within children's cartoons over time. This suggests an increasing recognition of the importance of such representation within this specific genre.

Lastly, the data visualized in our final table offers a numerical perspective on the number of characters with specific sexual orientations. These quantitative insights reinforce the growth and diversity of LGBTQIA+ representation within children's cartoons. Moreover, they highlight the presence of a wide range of sexual orientations and the diverse roles that each character assumes.

These findings have important consequences. They indicate a positive trend of growing LGBTQIA+ representation in children's cartoons that is likely to continue in the future. They also emphasize the importance of a diverse and inclusive media landscape, particularly for young audiences. Exposure to and understanding of various identities allows individuals, especially the youth, to gain familiarity with and embrace new perspectives.

In conclusion, our analysis of the data provides valuable insights into the evolving landscape of LGBTQIA+ representation within children's cartoons. It highlights the progress made thus far and emphasizes the significance of diverse and inclusive media content, particularly for the younger generation.
