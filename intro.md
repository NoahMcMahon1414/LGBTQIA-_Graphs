![Some LGBTQIA+ Cartoon Characters](intro_image.png){width=95%}

Our dataset highlights the different varieties of representation in cartoon shows. Our data set has a diverse amount of data that compares between platforms, orientation, gender, race, and more. Overall, we are working to discover and make comparisons between different forms of representation seen in various cartoon shows.

One research question we will be working on is how different studios provide LGBTQIA+ representation, and comparing different components of this. For example, we can measure from the number of TV shows a studio has that involves representation, or it can be measured by the number of total characters a studio has that represent the LGBTQIA+ community.

Another question we will discuss is how different sexual orientations are represented. For example, which orientation is most commonly represented in the LQBTQIA+ community, as well as which groups may be lacking representation. Another question similar to this would be to compare the gender orientations of these characters as well, to see which genders are being represented more than others.

Just as we grew up with these shows, cartoons have a large impact and long lasting influence on who we become as people. Because of this, we find this data set to be incredibly important to analyze, for it will provide information on shows and studios that have high representation, as well as those that still need improvement. Representation is important, so researching data such as this to detect information on it is a vital way to ensure change in the right direction is made.

Our dataset is from this website: https://www.insider.com/lgbtq-cartoon-characters-kids-database-2021-06?page=explore-database. The data was collected by a team at Insider.com, specifically reporting done by Abbey White and Kalai Chik; editing by Joi-Marie McKenzie, Brea Cubit, Emma LeGault, and Megan Willet-Wei; design and development by Sawyer Click, Skye Gould, Taylor Tyson, and Joanna Lin Su; and finally video by Chris Snyder, Jess Chou, A.C. Fowler, Kyle Desiderio, and Kuwilileni Hauwanga. The data was collected by scanning news clips, social media, GLAAD annual reports, and other character directories to find characters. From there, a two step plan was used to inform the character's place in the dataset. First, a character was regarded as either implicit or explicit, a metric of how directly LGBTQIA+ themes were understood by a young audience. This metric was greatly informed by interviews with experts in child development, gender, and sexuality. The second step involved analyzing the narrative techniques of the show, ranging from character interactions to dialogue. Any character's gender orientation, sexuality, race, or ability were either confirmed by the show, the creator, or the studio. If confirmation was unattainable, the entry was labeled undetermined or unknown. This dataset was compiled because there was not a descriptive enough dataset that existed for this information & LGBTQIA+ representation is greatly expanding in today's society and is being expanded in cartoons. There are 259 observations or rows and there are 30 features or columns. I do not think that we need to think of any ethical questions or questions of power while working with this dataset as the dataset has been compiled and put online for free. Additionally, this dataset is all about representation for those that are usually not represented, so no ethical questions. One possible limitation of this dataset is that it only considers characters confirmed to be part of the LGBTQIA+ community as of December 31, 2020, and there have been many more characters confirmed since then.

A challenge and limitation we might face is bias in the data collection. While using insider.com database as a resource, it us important to acknowledge that it does not capture all of the LGBTQIA+ representation in cartoons. As well as out data set does not have a lot of diversity as it does include a wide range of cartoons from many different studious, it still lack the representation of certain demographics, such as racial and ethnic minorities. Another challenge we have to deal with is the fact that we have to be careful of what we say or do since we need to ensure that our research does not perpetuate harmful stereotypes or stigmatize in certain groups. We would need to be transparent with out methodology and our finding in order to promote a greater understanding and inclusivity of LGTBQIA+ individuals in cartoons. A limitation would be the lack of data sets of different data sets we might be able to do.
